## Area & Circumference Calculator

## Project Overview

The **Area & Circumference Calculator** is a simple Java-based application that calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on the radius input provided by the user. The program also calculates the area of a sector given a specific central angle.

## Features

- **User Input:** The program uses the `Scanner` class to accept user input for the radius of the circle.
- **Calculation:**
  - **Area:** The area of the circle is calculated using the formula \( \pi \times r^2 \).
  - **Circumference:** The circumference of the circle is calculated using the formula \( 2 \times \pi \times r \).
  - **Sector Area:** The area of a sector is calculated using the formula \( \frac{\pi \times r^2 \times \alpha}{360} \), where \( \alpha \) is the central angle.
- **Output:** The program displays the calculated area, circumference, and sector area on the console.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief overview of the key components in the code:

- **Variable Declarations:** The radius is stored in an `int` variable, while `pi`, `area`, `circumference`, and `sector area` are stored in `double` variables.
- **User Input:** The program prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle using the `Scanner` class.
- **Area Calculation:** The area is calculated by multiplying `pi` with the square of the radius (`r`).
- **Circumference Calculation:** The circumference is calculated by multiplying `2`, `pi`, and the radius (`r`).
- **Sector Area Calculation:** The sector area is calculated using the given formula, where `alpha` represents the central angle.
- **Output:** The final area, circumference, and sector area are displayed to the user.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/uygarcode/area-circumference-calculator.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd area-circumference-calculator
    ```

3. **Compile and run the Java file:**

    ```bash
    javac AreaCircumferenceCalculator.java
    java AreaCircumferenceCalculator
    ```

4. **Enter the radius** when prompted to see the calculated area, circumference, and sector area.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the program might work:

```bash
Enter the radius: 5

Area: 78.5
Circumference: 31.4
Sector area: 1711.35
```
